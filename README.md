# threesLG

## Context

The problem is very clear and very simple.  It requires no backend...  though of course you can choose to add one as a Stretch Goal.  This allows you to reverse engineer an app and learn to write features, and then focus on the user experience.
## Required Specifications [Must Have]
- [ ] HTML/Vuejs on the front end
- [ ] A single player can play the game to completion
- [ ] There is a user interface similar to the app
- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
