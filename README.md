# threesLG

## Context

The problem is very clear and very simple.  It requires no backend...  though of course you can choose to add one as a Stretch Goal.  This allows you to reverse engineer an app and learn to write features, and then focus on the user experience.
## Required Specifications [Must Have]
- [ ] HTML/Vuejs on the front end
- [ ] A single player can play the game to completion
- [ ] There is a user interface similar to the app
- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)


## Set Up (AKA Play Our Game!)
1. Clone this repo.
2. Change directory into this repo with `$ cd threesLG`
3. Run `$ npm install` in the terminal once you are in this project file.
4. Run the `$ npm start` script. The game will automatically open in a new browser tab.
5. Use the arrow keys to move the pieces on the board. Tiles with the number 1 and 2 can combine to form a 3 tile. Tiles with the number 3 and and higher combine other tiles of the same number to double in value. Get as many points as possible!
